# Apple-Stock_predictions-using-SimpleRNN-LSTM
This project involves building deep learning models using SimpleRNN and LSTM to predict Appleâ€™s stock prices, focusing on its adjusted closing price. Given the sequential nature of stock market data, the goal is to capture temporal dependencies and forecast stock price movements for 1, 5, and 10-day intervals.
